yet he told himself this was the best way	RB ? VB PP DT ? AT ? ?
but i might have known	CC PP MD ? VB
we seem to be bound by love	PP VB TO BE VB IN NN

moreover even getting this across would be difficult	RB RB ? DT RB MD ? JJ
there was nothing he could do but wait	EX BE PN PP ? DO IN VB
for now it is clear that we were in the wrong	? RB PP BE JJ CS PP ? ? ? JJ
nevertheless you were its agent	? PP BE PP NN
jack what is the nature of this concept	NP WD BE AT ? IN ? NN
its a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other jack said	? AT NN ? NN IN WD DT ? VB PN IN AT ? NP VB
we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given	PP VB PP CS ? RB WR DT NN VB CS WD ? HV ? ? CS ? CC ? JJ CS ? PP HV VB
though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us	CS ? MD ? CS ? MD ? ? ? VB PP ? HV PN TO VB ?

then it is a matter of pleasure	RB PP BE AT NN IN ?

this explained a great deal	DT VB ? JJ NN
to this we of course agree	? DT PP IN ? VB
suppose that this one were to work	VB CS ? ? BE TO VB
if mankind could be convinced of that	? NN MD BE ? IN DT
in fact it had to be tried	IN NN PP ? TO BE VB
but there was no small way to handle this one	CC EX ? AT ? NN TO VB ? CD
